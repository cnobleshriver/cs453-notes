    "### Differences Between TCP and UDP\n",
    "\n",
    "#### TCP (Transport Control Protocol)\n",
    "- **Reliability**: Provides reliable, in-order delivery of data.\n",
    "- **Connection-Oriented**: Requires connection establishment (three-way handshake) before data transfer.\n",
    "- **Flow Control**: Uses flow control mechanisms to ensure data is sent at an appropriate rate.\n",
    "- **Congestion Control**: Implements congestion control to avoid network congestion.\n",
    "- **Error Checking**: Includes error checking and recovery mechanisms.\n",
    "- **Overhead**: Higher overhead due to additional features like reliability and congestion control.\n",
    "- **Use Cases**: Suitable for applications requiring reliable communication, such as web browsing, email, and file transfers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### UDP (User Datagram Protocol)\n",
    "- **Reliability**: Provides unreliable, unordered delivery of data.\n",
    "- **Connectionless**: No connection establishment required; data is sent without prior setup.\n",
    "- **Flow Control**: Does not implement flow control mechanisms.\n",
    "- **Congestion Control**: Does not implement congestion control.\n",
    "- **Error Checking**: Minimal error checking; no recovery mechanisms.\n",
    "- **Overhead**: Lower overhead due to the absence of reliability and congestion control features.\n",
    "- **Use Cases**: Suitable for applications that can tolerate loss or out-of-order delivery, such as video streaming, online gaming, and VoIP.\n",

    "## 3.2 Multiplexing and Demultiplexing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiplexing\n",
    "- **At Sender**:\n",
    "    - Handle data from multiple sockets\n",
    "    - Add transport header (later used for demultiplexing)\n",
    "    - Combine segments from different applications into a single data stream for transmission\n",
    "\n",
    "### Demultiplexing\n",
    "- **At Receiver**:\n",
    "    - Use header information to deliver received segments to the correct socket\n",
    "    - Direct segments to appropriate application based on transport header\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points\n",
    "- **Multiplexing and Demultiplexing**: Based on segment and datagram header field values.\n",
    "- **UDP Demultiplexing**: Uses destination port number only.\n",
    "- **TCP Demultiplexing**: Uses a 4-tuple consisting of source and destination IP addresses, and port numbers.\n",
    "- **Layer Operations**: Multiplexing and demultiplexing occur at all layers of the network stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "### TCP Socket Identification\n",
    "- Identified by a 4-tuple:\n",
    "    - Source IP address\n",
    "    - Source port number\n",
    "    - Destination IP address\n",
    "    - Destination port number\n",
    "\n",
    "### UDP Socket Identification\n",
    "- Identified by a 2-tuple:\n",
    "    - Destination IP address\n",
    "    - Destination port number\n",
    "\n",
    "### UDP Checksum\n",
    "- **Goal**: Detect errors (e.g., flipped bits) in transmitted segment.\n",
    "- **Sender**:\n",
    "    - Treat segment contents, including header fields, as a sequence of 16-bit integers.\n",
    "    - Compute checksum as the one's complement sum of segment contents.\n",
    "    - Place checksum value into the UDP checksum field.\n",
    "- **Receiver**:\n",
    "    - Compute checksum of the received segment.\n",
    "    - Compare computed checksum with the checksum field value:\n",
    "        - **NO**: Error detected.\n",
    "        - **YES**: No error detected (though errors may still exist)."
